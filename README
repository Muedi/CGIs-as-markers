This is exemplary Code for the Paper: "CpG-Islands as markers for Liquid Biopsies of Cancer patients."

The R code utilizes the comprehensive RnBeads package and one should be aquainted to the use of RnBeads. 
They provide some tutorials on their site and have a very nice support :)

The R-scripts takes the data given as either idat raw files from Illumina Methylation Chips or GEO-series directly from the GEO base. 
This was in our case depending on wether the files were accessible as raw data or as GEO-series.
The data is then controlled for Quality and preprocessed with the functions of RnBeads. 
RnBeads also provides the possiblity to combine different arrays to one dataset ommitting values, that are not present in all sets, which was used here.
After that, the complete set is normalized. 

The normalized data is dropped in the Output folder as a csv. 

The Python scripts take the csv-file and read the meth values from them. 
The PCA script just does the PCA and returns the respective figures. 
The looped script loops over three feature selecteions used and does 10 iterations of fitting and tuning a random forest to newly selected features, 
finally returning the mean of all given metrics and a sum of the selected features and mispredicted samples.

All machine learning functionalities are from the sci-kit learn library.
